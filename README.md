## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the clock and the change wallpaper button, including the necessary div elements for the clock hands and button.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file applies styling to the clock and button, incorporating background images, gradients, and shadows to achieve a realistic look. Media queries ensure proper layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript Logic**: The JavaScript file manages the clock's functionality:
   - **Clock Rotation**: Uses `setInterval` to update the rotation of the clock hands every second. Calculates rotation angles based on the current time and applies smooth transitions.
   - **Wallpaper Change**: The `changeWallpaper` function handles dynamic background changes with smooth transitions between different wallpapers.

4. **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries adjust the layout and size of the clock and button for smaller screens, maintaining proper alignment and visual appeal.
