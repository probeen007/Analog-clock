## Features

- **üé® Dynamic Wallpaper Change**: Seamlessly switch between various clock backgrounds with a single click. Enjoy a smooth transition effect that enhances the visual experience.
  
- **‚è∞ Realistic Clock Hands**: Designed with gradients and shadows, the clock hands create a realistic look. They rotate smoothly to reflect the accurate time, with subtle animations for a polished effect.

- **‚ú® Enhanced Animations**: Experience fluid transitions and easing effects for the clock hands. The clock also features a subtle pulse effect upon interaction, adding a dynamic touch.

- **üì± Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the clock and button are well-aligned and visible on both large and small screens.

- **üî≤ Visual Effects**: The button is designed to blend seamlessly with the background, featuring realistic depth and shadow effects to enhance visibility and interaction.

- **‚ôø Accessibility**: Designed with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.

## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the clock and the change wallpaper button, including the necessary div elements for the clock hands and button.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file applies styling to the clock and button, incorporating background images, gradients, and shadows to achieve a realistic look. Media queries ensure proper layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript Logic**: The JavaScript file manages the clock's functionality:
   - **Clock Rotation**: Uses `setInterval` to update the rotation of the clock hands every second. Calculates rotation angles based on the current time and applies smooth transitions.
   - **Wallpaper Change**: The `changeWallpaper` function handles dynamic background changes with smooth transitions between different wallpapers.

4. **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries adjust the layout and size of the clock and button for smaller screens, maintaining proper alignment and visual appeal.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/analog-clock-with-dynamic-wallpaper.git
